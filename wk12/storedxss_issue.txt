The problem with the stored XSS scenario outlined earlier is that user input, such as JavaScript code, is saved directly in a text file without proper sanitization. When this file is read and displayed, any malicious code injected by an attacker will be executed. This could lead to attacks like stealing session cookies, obtaining sensitive information, or gaining control of a user's browser.
